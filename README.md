# Solidity Math Functions with Improved Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in simple Solidity math functions and provides an improved solution.

The original code contains a `divide` function which fails if the divisor is 0. The improved version provides more informative error messages and uses the safest way to handle the error.
